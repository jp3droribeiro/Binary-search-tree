#  Interactive Binary Search Tree Visualization

## Overview
This project is an **interactive visualization** of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** developed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **NetworkX**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The application allows the user to enter a sequence of numbers, automatically generates the corresponding binary search tree, and displays its structure along with different **tree traversals**.
